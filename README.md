# 2018-Scouting-Program
Program that takes match averages and other useful things.
This program is being made to take scouting data and present it in a much more managable way. 
It will eventually be able to find the matches a team has competed in, and average their data for you.
This program currently uses data from 2017's FRC year until I create a scouting sheet for 2018.
If you find this, please note that I am not an expert programmer. None of what you see is exactly what you should do.
